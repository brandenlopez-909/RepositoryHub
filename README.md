# RepositoryHub


Welcome to my project page. Each folder contains a project I have worked but my more complex projects are listed below. 


- In *Improvements to Scalable Graph Neural Networks for Friend Recommendations* I explored that pruning GNNs with the Push-Flow Personalized Page-Rank algorithm leads to memory consumption stability and reduced convergence time without significant loss of accuracy. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/brandenlopez-909/topk_pprGraph)

- *Motion Transfer for Video Conferencing* which can be found [here](https://github.com/indranil53/Spr22_CS256_GroupA_Motion-Style-Transfer)

- Apache java application can be found [here](https://github.com/elizabethhillman/CS157A-Team2)
